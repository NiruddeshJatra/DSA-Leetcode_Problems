# Time Complexity: O(max(m, n)), where m and n are the lengths of the two linked lists.
# We traverse both linked lists once to compute the sum, making the time complexity linear.

# Space Complexity: O(max(m, n)), where m and n are the lengths of the two linked lists. 
# This is because the resulting linked list can be as long as the longer of the two lists, 
# plus one extra node if there is a carry at the end.

# INTUITION:
# The problem is to add two numbers represented by two linked lists, where each node contains a single digit. 
# The digits are stored in reverse order, and we need to return the sum as a linked list.
# We traverse the lists node by node, add the corresponding digits, and handle carry-over.

# ALGO:
# 1. Initialize a dummy head node to simplify handling edge cases. 
# 2. Traverse both linked lists, adding corresponding digits along with any carry from the previous addition.
# 3. If the sum of two digits is 10 or more, store the excess (sum - 10) in the current node and set the carry to 1.
# 4. If one list is longer than the other, continue processing the remaining nodes.
# 5. If thereâ€™s a carry after processing all the nodes, add a new node for the carry.
# 6. Return the result, skipping the dummy head node.
