# Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
# We traverse the entire linked list, reversing each group of k nodes in linear time.

# Space Complexity: O(1), as the algorithm only uses a constant amount of extra space 
# (for pointers and variables), not dependent on the input size.

# INTUITION:
# The problem requires reversing nodes in groups of k within a singly linked list.
# This involves identifying each group, reversing the nodes within it, and connecting the groups properly.
# We accomplish this by using a dummy node and pointers to keep track of each groupâ€™s start and end.

# ALGO:
# 1. Create a dummy node to simplify handling edge cases, and set it to point to the head of the list.
# 2. Traverse the linked list with a pointer. For each group of k nodes:
#    - Check if there are k nodes available.
#    - Reverse the k nodes in place.
#    - Reconnect the reversed group with the rest of the list.
# 3. Continue moving through the list, repeating the above steps for each k-group.
# 4. Return the list, skipping the dummy node.
