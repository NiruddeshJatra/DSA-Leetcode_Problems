# Time Complexity:
# - O(N) where N is length of array
# - For each number, we check at most 2 other positions (left and right at distance k)

# Space Complexity:
# - O(1) as we only use a few variables
# - No additional data structures needed

# INTUITION:
# A number is "good" if it's strictly greater than its neighbors at distance k.
# We check left and right neighbors at distance k for each position.
# Key insight: Just need to compare with neighbors at exactly distance k.
# Example: nums = [3,6,2,5,3], k = 2
# For nums[1] = 6:
# - Left at i-k = -1 (out of bounds, so valid)
# - Right at i+k = 3, nums[3] = 5 (6 > 5, so valid)
# 6 is a good number

# ALGO:
# 1. For each index i in array:
#    - Calculate left index (i-k) and right index (i+k)
#    - Check if current number is greater than both neighbors
#    - If left exists and current â‰¤ left, not good
#    - If right exists and current â‰¤ right, not good
#    - If good, add to total
# 2. Return sum of all good numbers
