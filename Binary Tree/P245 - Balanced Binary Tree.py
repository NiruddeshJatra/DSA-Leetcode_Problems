# Time Complexity:
# - O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree
# - We visit each node exactly once and perform O(1) work at each node
# - The height calculation and balance check are done during the same traversal

# Space Complexity:
# - O(H), where H is the height of the tree, used by the recursive call stack
# - In worst case (skewed tree), H = N, making it O(N)
# - No additional data structures are used beyond the call stack

# INTUITION:
# A binary tree is balanced if the heights of left and right subtrees differ by at most 1 
# for every node. We need both height and balance information at each step.
# Using bottom-up DFS is ideal because:
# 1. We can compute heights as we return up the tree
# 2. We can check balance criteria at each node in the same pass
# 3. We avoid recalculating heights multiple times (which would happen in a top-down approach)
# 4. Return tuple/list to carry both pieces of information (is_balanced and height)

# ALGO:
# 1. Define DFS helper function that returns [is_balanced, height]
# 2. Base case: empty node (None) returns [True, 0]
# 3. For each node:
#    - Recursively get [is_balanced, height] for left and right subtrees
#    - Current node is balanced if:
#      * Both subtrees are balanced
#      * Height difference between subtrees â‰¤ 1
#    - Return [current_node_balanced, 1 + max(left_height, right_height)]
# 4. Return only the is_balanced component of the result
